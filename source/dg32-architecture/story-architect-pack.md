# DG32-LITE architecture — story pack

Upstream of the client-ready deck and the narrated films. Sources: the five DG32 documents
(investor block diagram, tape-in block diagram, block architecture, LITE and 2DOM preliminary
datasheets) via `dg32-lite-architecture.md`. Publication level: investor (public site), so no
register maps, magic values, internal names or open review items.

**Storyline source (Rule 0).** No reference deck was supplied. The spine follows the block
architecture document's own order — design premises → top-level diagram → block internals →
performance and loop budget — bracketed by an executive summary up front and the investor
sheet's positioning and roadmap at the end.

## 1. BLUF

DG32-LITE puts hardware lockstep safety on an entry-level motor-control chip: two RISC-V cores
must agree on every write, the control loop runs in dedicated hardware at a fixed cost, and
first silicon on the September 2026 shuttle will measure what simulation predicts.

## 2. Audience decision

Motor-drive engineers and investors should believe the architecture is sound enough to evaluate
on first silicon, and treat the analog, flash and connectivity gaps as the roadmap, not surprises.

## 3. Tension

A silent CPU fault in a motor drive writes a wrong PWM edge, and a wrong edge can destroy a
bridge. Entry-level motor MCUs catch faults only periodically, in software; hardware lockstep has
been confined to automotive-class parts. Without a cheaper hardware option, safety-relevant drives
either over-buy silicon or accept the gap.

## 4. Argument arc

1. **Context** — what DG32-LITE is and the one-slide answer (slides 1–2).
2. **Tension** — why a silent fault matters in a power stage (3).
3. **Proof: structure** — six block groups on one bus, shaped by four hard constraints (4–5).
4. **Proof: safety** — lockstep chain, fault latch, hardware trip; self-sufficient boot (6–7).
5. **Proof: control** — dedicated signal chain, fixed loop cost, headroom by rate, timing (8–11).
6. **Implication** — package and the compute variant (12–13).
7. **Judgment** — honest comparison with the incumbent and the roadmap that closes the gaps (14–15).
8. **Action** — takeaways and what is not yet claimed (16).

## 6. Evidence map

**Direct evidence (source documents):** lockstep pair, 2-cycle checker, committed-store compare,
39-cycle inject latency; 64 KB ROM, 32 KB dual-port SRAM, boot sequence and UART monitor; PWM,
brake ≤2 cycles, DShot × 4; ADC 8-bit ~200 kSa/s, 177-cycle conversion; CORDIC 53–58 cycles;
~8 cycles per instruction; ~300-cycle fixed loop cost and the 10/20/50 kHz budget table; ~5 µs +
~5 µs ≈ 100 kHz loop; per-block post-route fmax; QFN-64 9 × 9 mm, 44 signal pins; ~0.43 W
estimate; 2DOM 114 MHz domain, bit-exact, 400 keys, timing closed; STM32G0 comparison rows and
roadmap.

**Fair synthesis:** 100 kHz budget row (500 cycles − 300 = ~200); 12% hardware share at 20 kHz
(300 / 2,500); pin-group counts summed to 44 from the pin table.

**Interpretation (kept soft or in notes):** "entry-level tier" positioning (the investor sheet's
own framing); "no functional-safety certification is claimed" (a statement about this deck, not
the product's future).

## 7. Content cuts

- Register maps, memory-map addresses, boot magic numbers, injection keys: confidential datasheet detail.
- Internal names, repositories, sign-off run history, open review items A–G: internal.
- Competitor prices or price multiples: banned claim class; the positioning argues capability only.
- Foundry, shuttle program and harness names: not needed for the argument.
- Negative timing slack and die-area figures: internal closure detail with no reader decision attached.

## 8. Rebuild instructions (for the deck builder)

- artifact-tool JSX with `deck-kit.mjs` primitives plus `kit-spec.mjs` type correction; cards `'auto'`.
- Titles ≤ 52 characters so they hold one line at full size; subtitles ≤ 105 characters.
- Dark slides: 1, 6, 16 (plus the dark thesis panel on 2). Everything else white.
- Every figure group carries the pre-silicon qualifier in a subtitle, card or source line.
- Speaker notes carry the narration below verbatim, so the deck and the films say the same thing.
- Architecture and flows are native shapes; no placed images in the deck.

## 9. Narration (speaker notes and film voiceover)

Chapters for the short films: **Why lockstep** (1–3) · **Inside the architecture** (4–8) ·

1. DG32-LITE is Deepgrid Semi's motor-control chip, and it makes one argument: hardware lockstep safety no longer needs an automotive-class microcontroller. Two RISC-V cores check each other on every write, inside a nine-by-nine millimetre package. First silicon rides the September 2026 multi-project shuttle, so every figure you will see is a design value, verified in simulation and timing analysis.
2. Here is the whole case in brief. DG32-LITE puts a microcontroller, its motor peripherals and its own safety monitor, built in hardware, into one one-hundred-thirty-nanometre part. The two cores check each other on every stored write. In simulation the current loop reaches about one hundred kilohertz, and a disagreement is latched within thirty-nine cycles, driving a pin that can shut the power bridge off.
3. Why build it this way? A motor drive switches power transistors thousands of times a second. If the CPU silently computes a wrong value, it writes a wrong PWM edge, and a wrong edge can short a bridge leg. Entry-level motor MCUs catch faults with watchdogs and periodic software self-test. Hardware lockstep has lived in automotive parts such as AURIX, S32K and Hercules.
4. The architecture is six groups of blocks around a single bus. The safety core, the memory and the supervisors sit on one side of it; the motor drive, sensing and math, and connectivity and test sit on the other. Only the CPU and a DMA can start a transfer, and every transfer takes a predictable time. Because the chip has no debugger halt, a bad address returns an error rather than freezing it.
5. Every design choice traces back to a limit found while hardening the chip. Nothing outside can halt the CPU, so nothing is allowed to hang. The lockstep core tops out between fifty-five and sixty-two megahertz, so the entire die is clocked at fifty. Each instruction costs about eight clock cycles, too slow for the loop, so the loop moved into hardware. And with no spare memory bits, the chip goes out without error correction, stated plainly.
6. This is the safety core. MAIN runs the application. CHECKER runs the same instructions two cycles later, on the same inputs, and the comparator checks every committed store. On a mismatch, the first cause is latched and FAULT_N goes low. Route that pin to the gate-driver enable, and the bridge turns off in hardware, without waiting for firmware.
7. Reaching running code takes no helper processor or debugger. Hard-wired ROM logic greets the serial console, confirms the image in external flash is valid, loads it into SRAM and hands over control. A board with empty flash is not stranded either: the ROM drops into a serial monitor that can program and start it. The price is copying code at every boot, since nothing runs directly out of flash.
8. Every expensive step of field-oriented control runs in a dedicated block. Encoder and Hall inputs give position, with edge timestamps. The PWM fires the ADC at the centre of each period, where ripple is lowest. The CORDIC computes the Park transforms, the CPU runs only the two PI regulators, and the PWM block applies the new duty cycles, with a hardware brake behind it.
9. Here is what one loop costs. The current sample takes one hundred seventy-seven cycles. Each CORDIC operation takes fifty-three to fifty-eight. The regulators cost about eight cycles per instruction. Together the hardware part is about three hundred cycles, and it is the same at every loop rate. At twenty kilohertz, that is twelve percent of the period.
10. So the question becomes how much firmware fits. At ten kilohertz there are about forty-seven hundred cycles left: enough for a full current and speed loop with an observer. At twenty kilohertz, twenty-two hundred, enough for field-weakening. At fifty kilohertz, seven hundred, an inner current loop only. The simulated ceiling is about one hundred kilohertz.
11. Timing tells the same story. After place-and-route, the GPIO, DShot, QSPI and PWM blocks all run above one hundred sixty-five megahertz, and CORDIC and the supervisor above ninety. Only the lockstep core, at fifty-five to sixty-two megahertz, sets the clock. No peripheral is ever the timing wall.
12. All of it fits a nine-by-nine millimetre QFN with sixty-four pins: forty-four signals, and the rest power and ground. Seven pins drive the bridge, six read position, two carry the analog current input, and a single pin, FAULT_N, shuts the drive down in hardware. Because DG32-2DOM uses exactly this pinout, a board built for one takes either chip.
13. DG32-2DOM keeps everything in DG32-LITE and adds an INT8 attention engine on its own one hundred fourteen megahertz clock. It reaches memory through clock-domain-crossing bridges, so it never stalls the fifty megahertz control core. Its output is bit-exact to the software model, and timing closes at both clocks. It is designed for bearing-fault and anomaly detection inside the drive.
14. Against the STM32G0, the entry-level incumbent, the comparison is honest. DG32 leads on hardware lockstep, native DShot, hardware CORDIC and the on-chip AI variant, with an open RISC-V core. The G0 leads clearly on its twelve-bit multi-channel ADC, embedded flash, USB and CAN-FD, and on production maturity.
15. The roadmap works through those weaknesses, largest first. First silicon, on the September twenty twenty-six shuttle, tests the simulations against real parts. The following spin tackles the two largest gaps: an analog converter with twelve bits and several channels, and flash on the die. Only after that come CAN-FD and interactive debugging. DG32-2DOM advances meanwhile, its design finished and now in physical trials.
16. Three ideas to hold on to. The protection is built into the processor itself, not bolted on in software. The costly parts of motor control are dedicated hardware, so the price of one loop is fixed and known in advance. And the weaknesses are named, with fixes scheduled. None of this has yet been measured on silicon, and no functional-safety certification is claimed; bring-up is where the numbers become real.
