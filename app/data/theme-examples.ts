// Example questions for each curated answer (executiveThemes in graphrag-engine.ts), phrased the way a
// visitor asks rather than the way the answer is written. A question is matched against these by
// meaning (question-to-question similarity is far sharper than question-to-document), and a theme's
// score is its best example. Keys are theme titles: renaming a theme without updating its key fails
// `npm run build:semantic`, and the site build fails until the index is rebuilt.
//
// When a visitor question misses its answer, add a question like it here, run `npm run build:semantic`,
// and the routing eval (scripts/ask-routing-eval.json) confirms nothing else broke. Never copy an eval
// question in here: the eval would then be grading its own answers.
