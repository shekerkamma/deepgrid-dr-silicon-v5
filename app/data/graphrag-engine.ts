    lead: 'Resolving induction motor slip sidebands separated by 0.5 to 3 Hz over a 30- to 100-second record would require an 8-Megabyte RAM buffer to execute a conventional 2^20-point FFT. DG32-LITE eliminates this multi-megabyte memory penalty by deploying an 8-bin Goertzel recurrence filter that evaluates only the discrete physical sideband frequencies in 6,144 cycles (0.12 ms) within just 16.5 KB of SRAM.',
    explanation: [
      'The Physical & Memory Challenge: Broken rotor bar faults produce current signature sidebands at fb = f1(1 ± 2s), where s is motor slip (typically 1% to 5%). Separating these narrow peaks (0.5–3 Hz from the 50 Hz fundamental) requires long continuous sampling windows of 30 to 100 seconds at 0.01 to 0.05 Hz bin resolution. Performing an unconstrained full-spectrum 2^20-point FFT on this window would require 8 MB of RAM—demanding a costly external DRAM chip and power-hungry memory controller.',
      'The Goertzel Solution on a 50 MHz Core: Rather than computing thousands of unneeded spectral bins across the full bandwidth, DG32-LITE implements second-order IIR Goertzel recurrence filters targeted exclusively at the exact 8 predicted sideband harmonic frequencies. The entire 8-bin calculation consumes only 6,144 clock cycles (0.12 ms on the 50 MHz core) and executes entirely inside internal SRAM, preserving 82% CPU execution headroom for standard motor control.',
      'Dynamic Range & AFE Realities: ISO 20958 establishes that broken rotor bar sidebands sit 40 to 60 dBc below the 50 Hz fundamental. Because standard 8-bit ADCs provide only 42 dB of usable dynamic range under ISO 13373-2 (D = 6(N-1) dB), these sidebands would disappear beneath the quantization noise floor. DeepGrid pairs the Goertzel algorithm with 12-to-16-bit analog front ends or analog fundamental notch filtering, guaranteeing reliable detection before bar breakage destroys the stator.'

    lead: 'Kurtosis is non-monotonic: it spikes dramatically upon initial bearing defect impact, but as damage spreads into widespread flaking and spalling, the vibration signal becomes continuous and kurtosis falls back toward Gaussian baseline (K ≈ 3.0). Alarming on kurtosis alone creates a dangerous blind spot where severely degraded bearings appear healthy.',
    explanation: [
      'The Incipient vs. Advanced Spall Progression: In an undamaged bearing, vibration signals exhibit a Gaussian amplitude distribution with kurtosis K ≈ 3.0. When an incipient localized fatigue spall appears on a race, sharp mechanical impacts cause sudden, high-amplitude transients that push kurtosis up to 8.0–15.0. However, as running hours accumulate, repetitive impacts smooth out into broad surface roughness. The vibration amplitude increases, but impulses blend into continuous noise, causing kurtosis to collapse back to ~3.0.',
      'The Dual-Metric Surveillance Architecture: DeepGrid pairs non-monotonic kurtosis with monotonic RMS vibration velocity. While kurtosis is an exceptional early-warning indicator for initial defect inception, RMS velocity tracks total kinetic energy dissipation and increases monotonically with physical defect size. DeepGrid diagnostic firmware enforces a dual-metric rule: kurtosis flags defect initiation, while RMS velocity dictates mandatory maintenance shutdown per ISO 20816 severity thresholds.',
      'Hardware Implementation on DG32-LITE: Because the primary RV32IM core retains 82% unburdened execution budget, time-domain kurtosis and RMS velocity extraction execute in just 3,200 clock cycles (0.06 ms) across 1,024 decimated vibration samples.

      'The Data Leakage Vulnerability: Standard academic benchmarks (such as the widely cited Case Western Reserve University bearing dataset) are typically partitioned using random train/test sample splits.
