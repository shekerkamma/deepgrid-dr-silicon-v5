Mirroring the bus responses means firmware can branch on peripheral reads without the cores diverging.'},
    {name: 'Comparator and fault latch', what: 'Compares every committed store; the first mismatch sets a sticky latch with its cause and drives FAULT_N.', why: 'Comparing on the store gives a signature that does not depend on external timing, and the first cause is the diagnostic one. A locked injection register lets firmware fire the path on purpose, the only way to prove it on real silicon.'},

Built as logic rather than a memory macro, deepening it was measured as effectively free.'},

    {name: 'QSPI controller', what: 'Maps external NOR flash and PSRAM into memory as a data window.', why: 'Keeping the die flash-less keeps the 130 nm process simple. The cost is loading code at boot instead of executing in place; embedded flash is on the roadmap.'},

DG32 brings the mechanism to the entry-level motor-control tier.'},

The G0 is clearly ahead here, which is why a 12-bit multi-channel ADC is the first roadmap item.'},
  {name: 'Why the application loads at boot', what: 'The G0 executes in place from embedded flash; DG32-LITE copies its application from external flash into SRAM.', why: 'A flash-less die keeps the 130 nm process simple for a first spin. Embedded flash comes with the second spin.'},
  {name: 'Why the roadmap runs in this order', what: 'Analog and program memory first, then CAN-FD and interactive CPU debug.', why: 'The analog front end and program memory are where the incumbent leads most clearly, so they close first. Connectivity and debug follow, while DG32-2DOM proceeds in parallel.'},

/** The ten-chip portfolio, reconciled against its two primary sources on 2026-09-23:
 *  `deepgrid-sku-compendium-architecture.md` (Technical Annex v3, the 14-sheet matrix) and
 *  `deepgrid-mature-silicon-architecture.md` section 7 (Ten-Chip Portfolio). The two agree
 *  exactly, Chip N = SKU N, which is what makes the corrections below safe.
 *
 *  Four things were wrong in the previous version of this list, all of them silent:
 *  - DG32-LITE was numbered SKU-1. SKU-1 is the BLDC Motor Controller. DG32-LITE is **SKU-4**,
 *    the Lockstep Safety MCU: 130 nm CMOS, 1.8V/3.3V, dual DGridRiscV at 2-cycle skew,
 *    ISO 26262 ASIL-D. Both sources say so independently.
 *  - DG32-2DOM was numbered SKU-2, which is the Smart-Meter SoC. 2DOM is not one of the nine:
 *    it is the DG32-LITE die plus the INT8 engine, so it is recorded as a SKU-4 variant.
 *  - DG-D100 was numbered SKU-3, which is the Hi-Rel PMIC. D100 is **Track B**, funded and
 *    scoped separately. Its node is the Annex matrix's "130nm + 28nm SiP": a 130 nm die and a TSMC
 *    28 nm die in one package (2026-09-24; it was listed as 65 nm, then as TSMC 28 nm alone).
 *  - Nodes for SKU-8 and SKU-9 were wrong: 130 nm HV CMOS and 130 nm + 180 nm respectively.
 *
 *  "Phase" now means what the source means by it. The mature-silicon architecture defines three
 *  *factories*, not three dates: Phase 1 SkyWater (USA), Phase 2 IHP (Germany), Phase 3 SCL
 *  Mohali (India). The previous list attached calendar years to those labels, which neither
 *  source supports. The compendium separately defines a three-*node* roadmap (130/180 nm ->
 *  90/55 nm -> next); the two schemes are not the same axis and are no longer conflated here.
 *
 *  Anchor customers are deliberately omitted. The sources name one for Chip 4 as a
 *  "₹1.01 Cr contracted" figure that verification found materially misdescribed, so no
 *  customer or revenue claim is carried onto the site from this table.
